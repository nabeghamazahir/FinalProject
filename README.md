# Car Rental
This is a car rental application built using Flask, a web framework in Python. The app allows users to search for available cars based on their desired pickup and drop-off dates. It retrieves car data from a mock API and checks for available cars within the specified dates. Users can then select a car and proceed to the final booking page, where they provide their personal details like name, email, and phone number. The booking details are stored in another mock API, and the car's booking dates are updated accordingly. The app ensures that cars are not double-booked during the same period. Overall, it provides a simple interface for users to search and book cars for rent.
